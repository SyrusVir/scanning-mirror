 * 
 * Description: The purpose of these functions is to implement a thread-safe poller that uses busy waiting
 *              to detect as quicly as possible when an input IO pin reads a specified level. This is done
 *              by executing the polling loop in a thread that (ideally) executes on a dedicated CPU core.
 *              When the specified event is detected, a spin lock is locked and is unlocked after a specified 
 *              number of microseconds has elapsed. Spin locks are used instead of mutexes for decreased overhead.
 *              
 *              Usage steps:
 *              1)  call pinPollerInit() - this configures the pin poller
 *              2)  call pthread_create() with pinPollerMain() as the function parameter - this starts the main polling loop
 *                                                                                     in the specified thread
 *              3)  Raise exit_flag - using the pointer returned by pinPollerInit(), raise the exit_flag to terminate the
 *                                    polling loop
 *              4)  call pinPollerDestroy() - this simply frees the memory space allocated to hold the pin poller structure
 * 
 *              GPIO IO interfacing is done using the pigpio library
 *
